## Overview

Certainly! A QR code component I built with HTML and CSS would primarily focus on the visual presentation of QR codes within a web page. Here's an overview of my project:

### Project Overview:

#### 1. Purpose:

- The purpose of the project is to create a visually appealing and functional QR code component that can be embedded into web pages.
- The component allows users to display QR codes representing various types of data such as URLs, text, contact information, etc.

#### 2. Features:

- **QR Code Display**: Display QR codes representing different types of data.
- **Customization**: Allow customization of QR code appearance such as size, color, and margin.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the QR code component is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Accessibility**: Make the component accessible to users by providing alternative text for the QR code.
- **Hover Effects**: Provide interactive hover effects to enhance user experience.

#### 3. Components:

- **HTML Structure**:

  - The HTML structure defines the layout of the QR code component and its associated elements.
  - It includes elements for displaying the QR code image and any additional information or controls.

- **CSS Styling**:
  - CSS is used to style the QR code component, including its appearance, layout, and responsiveness.
  - It defines properties such as size, color, margin, and hover effects to enhance the visual presentation.

#### 4. Technologies:

- **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)**: Used to define the structure and content of the web page, including the QR code component.

- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**: Used to style the QR code component, applying visual enhancements and layout adjustments.

- **QR Code Image**: The QR code image itself is typically generated using a QR code generator tool or library and is then embedded into the HTML code.

#### 5. Additional Considerations:

- **Accessibility**: Ensure that the QR code component is accessible to all users by providing alternative text for the QR code image.

- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Test the QR code component across different web browsers to ensure consistent appearance and functionality.

- **Responsive Design**: Implement responsive design techniques to ensure that the QR code component adapts to various screen sizes and devices.

- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the size and loading time of the QR code component, especially if it contains large images or complex CSS styles.

### Conclusion:

A QR code component built with HTML and CSS provides a simple yet effective way to display QR codes on web pages. By focusing on visual presentation, customization options, and accessibility, the component enhances user experience and facilitates the sharing of information through QR codes.

## My process

1. I Defined the HTML Structures:
   .Created the HTML structure for the QR code component.
   .This structures typically includes a container element for the QR code image and additional elements for customization or Design.

2. Style the Component with CSS:
   .Applied CSS styles to customize the appearance of the QR code component.
   .Defined properties such as size, color, margin, and alignment to make the component visually appealing.

3. Embedded QR Code Image in the HTML:
   .Inserted the QR code image into my HTML structure.
   .Used the 'src' attribute to specify the URL of the QR code image.
   .Provided meaningful alternative text for accessibility purposes using the 'alt' attribute

4. Ensure Accessibility:
   .Provide meaningful alternative text for the QR code image using the 'alt' attribute to ensure accessibility for users who rely on screen readers or other assistive technologies.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

1. HTML Structure:
   .I understand the structure of HTML elements and how they are used to create web components.
   .Learnt about semantic HTML and how to structure content in a meaningful way.

2. CSS Styling:
   .Learnt how to apply CSS styles to customize the appearance of web components.
   .Learnt Using CSS properties such as 'width', 'height', 'margin' 'padding' 'Grid', and 'border' to style elements.
   .Explored CSS selectors and specificity to target and style specific elements within the component.

3. Accessibility:
   .I understand the importance of accessibility in web development.
   .Learnt how to provide meaningful alternative text for images using the 'alt' attribute for screen reader users.

4. Image Handling:
   .Learnt about image optimization techniques to improve performance, such as image compression.....

5. Project Workflow:
   .Learnt how to plan and organize the project structure
   .Leanrt how to manage project files and assets effectively.
   .Leanrt Version control using Git and GitHub for collaboration and code management.

6. Continous Learning:
   .Recognize that building a QR code component is just one step in the learning journey.
   .Seeking opportunities to expand knowledge and skills in web development through practice, experimentation, and ongoing learning resources.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

<div><div>
<img>
<p></p>
<table></table>

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
  display: grid;
  background-color: black;
  justify-content: center;
  transition: transform 1.3s;
  position: absolute;
  width: 50%;
  height: 50px;
}
```

### Continued development

1. JavaScript and DOM Manipulation:
   .I will try to learn JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamic behaviour to my QR code component.
   .Will explore DOM manipulation techniques to modify HTML elements dynamically based on user interactions or events.

2. Responsive Web Design:
   .I wil deepen my understanding of responsive web design principles to ensure my QR code component looks good and functions well on different devices and screen sizes.
   .Will learn about CSS media queries, flexbox, and grid layout to create responsive and flexible designs.

3. Accessibility:
   .I will explore web accessibility standards and best practices to ensure my QR code component is accessible to users with disabilities.
   .Will learn how to use ARIA roles and attributes, semantic HTML, and keyboard navigation to improve accessibility.

  4. CSS Preprocessors and Postprocessors:
  . I will familiarize myself with CSS preprocessors like Sass or less to streamline my CSS development process with features like variables, mixins, and nesting.
  . I will  Explore CSS postprocessors like Autoprefixer to automatically add vendor prefixes and optimize CSS code.

  5. Version Control and Collaboration:
  . I will master version control with Git and learn about branching, merging, and resolving and conflicts to manage my project's codebase effectively.
  . I wil explore collaborative development workflows and platforms like GitHub or GitLab for sharing and collaborating on
